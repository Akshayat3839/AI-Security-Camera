# ??? AI Security Camera (Smart Surveillance System)

A real-time AI-powered security camera system built using Python and OpenCV that detects motion, captures evidence, records video, and logs events automatically.

This project simulates a smart CCTV system using Computer Vision.

# ?? Features

? Real-time motion detection using frame differencing  
? Automatic image capture on motion detection  
? Auto video recording during motion events  
? Face detection using Haar Cascades  
? Person detection using HOG descriptor  
? Timestamp-based activity logging  
? Live bounding boxes for motion, face, and person detection  
? On-screen security HUD (FPS, status, alerts)  
? Fully works using a normal webcam

# ?? Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Security-Camera.git
cd AI-Security-Camera
pip install opencv-python

?? Run the Project
python main.py

AI-Security-Camera/
?
??? main.py               # Main application
??? README.md
??? captures/             # Saved images on motion
??? recordings/          # Auto recorded videos
??? logs/                # Activity logs
??? videos/              # Optional storage

?? How It Works
Webcam captures live video
Frames are compared to detect motion
If motion is detected:
Bounding boxes are drawn
Image is saved automatically
Video recording starts
Event is logged with timestamp
Face and person detection runs in parallel
Live HUD shows system status
